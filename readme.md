# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## Overview
Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic game played between two players on a 3x3 grid. The players take turns placing their markers (X or O) in empty cells, aiming to align three markers in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. This project implements both player vs. player and player vs. AI modes.
